It is highly recommended to download the files and try the simulation out for yourself. It shows information regarding the current run that is not mentioned in the report due to not being relevant after aggregation.

To set it up: Download all files from the repository and simply open the index.html file in a web browser. The simulation will appear as a website, which you are then free to use as you wish.

To use it: Fill in your desired parameters in the appropriate fields. Make sure to follow the right input format. All fractions should be written in the form "0.x".

Parameter format: Wizards (N) and Death eaters (M) should be whole numbers; Curse effectiveness (p) is a fraction; Security efficiency (se) is a fraction

A note on comments: The file model.js contains all important mathematical functions, which have been fully commented. Other files are mostly required for set up and visualization and do not have comments.
